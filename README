Proxy Manager

Mojolicious based proxy manager, with proxy checker function.

Allows you to keep track of a list of geo-sensitive proxies for use
in SEO rank tracking, PPC analysis and other proxy uses.

Install
-------
Prerequisites are:

* Mojolicious
* Modern::Perl
* WWW::ProxyChecker
* MongoDB

Simply run the main Mojolicious app in Morbo/Hypnotoad and set the 
proxy checker to run via crontab on an hourly (for example) basis to
check the proxies are still live.

Obviously you'll need a running MongoDB process and a DB with proxies in 
it. The following MongoDB structure will work with this app:

	{
	  "_id": { "$oid" : "50AB7C4963EACAD554000000" },
	  "country": "United Arab Emirates",
	  "ccode": "ae",
	  "status": "new",
	  "ip": "1.2.3.4",
	  "added": 1353415753,
	  "port": "8080"
	}
